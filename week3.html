                    <h2 class="section-heading">First Ideation</h2>
                    <p>First ideas include:<br>
                      . trying to combine bathing culture and tool-human relationship. Think of the steam, the water<br>
                      . dressing up Luca and K as Cola cans and have them interact with each other. Dont ask why<br>
                      . using one object, e.g. a pen, and design its interaction in the way that major western/eastern phylosophies would have done it. How would Plato design a pen? How would a Taoist pen be? How would a Christian pen be?<br>
                      . designing interactive chairs that have feelings towards the user and towards each other. OOO</p>

                      <span class="caption text-muted">Mental schematic of our joined research interests</span>
                      <p>From that point onward, we decided to investigate three areas, trying to bring forward concepts of animism, shintoism, phenomenology and object-oriented onthology. Pretty much wild and free exploration, a bit de-contextualised.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Interaction Explorations</h2>
                    <p>Doing interaction studies without a context proved to be quite fun for nerds, yeah. All in all, we tried to put together a very simple scenario. We aimed at a neutral object of neutral shape. The closest we could get to such an ideal situation was a pair of trivial sticks. In the scenario, one stick is an actuator and one is a sensor. Two behaviors were designed, thinking of the ideas of animism and OOO. The underlying questions of these exploration where:<br>
                    . can the behavior of an object manifest the fact that the object has a spirit, or an inner form of identity, at large?<br>
                    . is that even relevant, meaning, how would the perception of an object change to me if I knew it has a soul?<br>
                  Ovbiosly the two scenario that where investigated are quite speculative and, to some extent, ridicolous.
                  </p>
                  <h5>Curious/Playful behaviour</h5>
                  <p>What if any object could be animated through some actuator and be able to communicate with you when it wants to interact, much like a pet-owner relationship? In this scenario, the stick on the left calls for attention and then follows the position of the stick on the right, once it is touched by a third object, a human.</p>

                  <h5>Angry/Protective behaviour</h5>
                  <p>Starting from an anecdote, few nights back Luca squeezed a soda can in front of Nakia and K. Nakia shivered and K admitted it hurted somehow, while Luca just thought he did squeeze a piece of aluminum, nothing more. Do object perceive pain? In this scenario, when the stick on the right is perturbated and mistreated by the object-human, the stick on the left jumps onto the stage in order to defend its mate.</p>
