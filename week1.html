                    <p><i><b>Summary of the week</b><br>
                      During the first week we spent most of the time in individually researching topics of interest. Towards the end of the week we agreed on starting this journey together. First we researched quite freely in body augmentation projects, mainly in the speculative realm. We wanted to avoid fashion/tattoos. Then we started to think on whether there was a connection in the way western/eastern folks design augmented devices for their bodies, starting from an historical phylosophical perspective. Eventually we decided to narrow down to a specifi context, the bath house and bathing rituals. Eventually we attended the first crit with all the tutors.</i>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Research on Body Augmentation</h2>

                    <p>What is body augmentation? Can we find different categories to differentiate different kinds of augmentation? These were the first questions that we asked ourselves. Below is the definition according to <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/29306/human-augmentation">technopedia</a>.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      Human augmentation is generally used to refer to technologies that enhance human productivity or capability, or that somehow add to the human body. Modern advancements in many areas of IT have led to a greater variety of implants and other technologies that could be classed as human augmentation. Human augmentation may also be called human 2.0.
                    </blockquote>

Based on the kind of references we found, we did sort the references into a mood board. Three layers of information are included. On the first level, we marked each project with either a R=real or a F=fictional. Then we designed a matrix 2x2 where we put "physical augmentation" and "cognitive augmentation" on the x-axis and we put "enhancement" and "distortion" on the y-axis.</p>

                    <p><h5>Judaism-Christianity</h5>Nature is the result of God’s will, dominance of man over nature, where the body is the temple of the soul.</p>

                    <blockquote>Out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name. <br><br>Genesis 2:19</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>You must know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is within—the Spirit you have received from God. You are not your own. So glorify God in your body.<br><br>Paulus, 1 Corinthians 6:19–20</blockquote>

                    <p><h5>Ancient Greece</h5>Nature as a background to man’s activity. Man and nature should cohabit in harmony.</p>

                    <blockquote>This world, which is the same for all, no one of gods or men has made. But it always was and will be: an ever-living fire, with measures of it kindling, and measures going out.<br><br>Eraclitus, Fragments</blockquote>

                    <blockquote>While he is drinking he beholds himself reflected in the mirrored pool—and loves; loves an imagined body which contains no substance, for he deems the mirrored shade a thing of life to love.<br><br>Ovid, Metamorphosis Book 3</blockquote>

                    <p><h5>Modern Phylosophy</h5>Substance Dualism. This philosophy states that the mental can exist outside of the body, and the body cannot think. Following phylosophy of Cartesio.</p>

Then comes the harmony. Eyes seeking five colors, ears seeking five sounds, mouths seeking five flavours, thus hearts will do good to the society.

                <h2 class="section-heading">Bath Culture</h2>
                <p>Given the fact that we are supposed to deliver a project within 5 weeks, we thought of narrowing down to the topic of bathing rituals in order to plan the construction of a feasible prototype. In bathing rituals, different cultures look at the body in specific ways. We are not so keen on architecture of steam houses as we are interested in the props that facilitate the rituals of entering such spaces. We run into this fantastic magazine called <a href="http://www.wetmagazine.com/">Wet</a>, which for a couple of months documented bathing cultures in a glamour way. Then we also looked at the exhibition <a href="http://www.kvadratinterwoven.com/soak-steam-dream">"Soak, Steam, Dream"</a> that took place here in London until few weeks ago.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">First Crit Comments</h2>

                    <p>
                      <h5>Matt</h5>
                      . Marshall McLuhan - Medium is the message: in the first chapter he talks about how technology has evolved human society in <b><i>three stages</i></b> (mechanical age, electric age and global consciousness) in relation to three main technological achievements (motor, electricity, "internet")</br>
                      . Franz Kafka - Die Verwandlung (the metamorphosis)</br>
                      . Francesca Alfano Miglietti - identità mutanti</br>
                      . Stelarc, Matthew Barney (early works)</p>

                      <h5>Ruairi</h5>
                      . You're basically recognizing the distinctions between the western and eastern philosophy, that has a lot to do with, like you're saying the Judah Christian and seperation of body and mind, which doesn't exist in eastern philosophy, right? So, the person you probably need to recognize in the western philosophy, <b><i>René Descartes</i></b>, who kinds of.. he brought the book of the idea of animals are machines, but, the human being is different because they have these mind or so. And the <b><i>environment</i></b> would be my extension, which(what) is so interesting about eastern philosophy is (that) they understands that when there's environment, there's probably not much mind, or intelligence, and we 're who we're because of the environment we're inside of.</br>
                      . I think eastern philosophy, is finding its relationship closer to contemporary science than the western traditions.</br>
                      . And then you jumped to bathing, and for me it's like, "ok, that's interesting, that's not expected, that's what I'm excited about", but I can't imagine how you made that jump. I just need you guys to be propositional about it</br>
                      . Another distinction between the cultures, particularly between Japanese and English for instance, is the relationships of health robotics as well.<br>
                      . Japanese culture has a spiritual relationship with a tool, like <i><b>kiri</i></b>? you burn in the temple. That could be your spiritual relationship, like <i><b>animism</i></b>, like a Japanese saiki? that is the connection to everything that is around you. So there's totally different thinking about <i><b>robotics</i></b>. Sort of spiritual animism. There's a book called the Buddha in the Robot. The spiritual surrounding  in the eastern philoshophy is not a chaos, is not sth that look down upon you, but in the things that is around you.</br>
                      . Or you end up with  <i><b>tools</i></b> that represent the cultures that they come from.</br>
                      . And eastern philosophy has a lot offer western views of that a lot of technology is getting made in the east, so i wonder what the western contributions is back.<br>
                      . Start to put together 2 or 3 proposals, you probably have the favorite, but you still work the other ones up, you can discover which one you like by working them up. Mentally and physically  and everything, spiritually... and talking and drawing.
                    </p>

                      . Yeah i'm kind of getting a bit confused of what they have. Because it was kind of clear in the beginning. Then, talking of the relationships of the bathing. Then, i think... I mean, the topic is really really facinating, the(...body augmentation with?</br>
                      . <b><i>Antony Gomley</b></i>'s work, a bath house, a square box filled with steam.</br>

                      . In the Bartlett all the bathing houses have been done. I would never let undergraduate students do the bathing room. I love the first part of the presentation, there's really some juicy ideas  that you could get sth from it. But maybe you start with the bath idea, maybe you can change to sth else. Maybe you start with it as an idea of <b><i>skin</b></i>,  and then it evolves to sth else. These ideas of a bathing suit or bath room, maybe a little bit too prescript and too early? I understood when you said bath room, it's a pretty temr and in terms of work.  But the different ideas of nature, and different perception of body, and nature, you know the east and west, is super interesting.</p>

                      <h5>Ami</h5>
                      . You can look into the <b><i>history of bathing</b></i>  as well, like in Margate has a kind of history of people going there, it's a healthy thing, it was about water, and you can just look at that, how it changes and how it may relate to the differences between body and mind.<br>
                      . Looking for <b><i>Donna Haraway</b></i>, similar to the things you've said, that the skin is the boundary that you've got to the environment. I think it could be the point, that this exists in both cultures, start from that point, and where does it go.</p>

                  <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusions</h2>

                  <p>We can conclude from the crit that there is an interesting underlying content in our ideas. Body augmentation and cultural differences have potential. However, the jump to bathing culture is not so immediate and might have to be reconsidered. Which other scenario can be investigated? Gym?
